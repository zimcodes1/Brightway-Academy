to what lies within us,” so said Ralph Waldo Emerson.

Through our curriculum, we aim to develop the full potential of each learner as a citizen of

a dynamic world. At the end of the day, we hope to produce a life-long learner

who is compassionate, confident, independent, literate, and multi-skilled: a critical learner

that has respect for the environment and is able to make a desirable impact

on the society. At BrightWay, we value our learners and in return expect them

.to uphold the Mission and Vision of the school.

NURSERY
BWIA has balanced approaches to early education with a curriculum that combines the teaching of basic letters, numeracy literacy with play and interaction between children.

One of the most important things we do at BWIA is to develop children's self-confidence both socially and educationally. We do this by providing a happy and cheerful environment and varied time tables that children enjoy; making their days "fun." This gives them enthusiasm for learning.
